Introduction:
The Payroll web application, built on Spring Boot, Hibernate, Java, and MySQL, aims to address the persistent challenges faced by businesses in efficiently managing their payroll processes. Payroll management is a critical aspect of any organization, encompassing the calculation and distribution of employee salaries, tax deductions, and other benefits. This project seeks to optimize and automate these operations, ensuring accuracy, reducing manual errors, and ultimately improving the overall efficiency of payroll management.

Problem Statement:
Traditional payroll management methods often rely on manual calculations and paper-based records, leading to a multitude of challenges. These include time-consuming processing, potential errors in calculations, difficulty in maintaining compliance with changing tax regulations, and limited visibility into payroll data. These inefficiencies can result in delayed payments, dissatisfied employees, and increased administrative burden.
